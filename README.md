## Create Virtual Environement 
A virtual environment isolates your Python projectâ€™s dependencies from your system Python and other projects.
This prevents version conflicts and makes your project easier to manage and share.

## Navigate to your project directory

### cd ~/Bureau 

## Create a virtual environment (named venv):

### python3 -m venv myenv

## Activate the virtual environment:

### source venv/bin/activate

## Install dependencies (e.g., Pillow):
Pillow is a popular Python library for image processing.
It is a modern fork of the original Python Imaging Library (PIL) and provides tools to open, manipulate, create, and save many different image file formats.

Common uses:

Creating images from scratch
Editing and drawing on images
Converting between image formats
Resizing, cropping, rotating images

### pip install pillow

## Run your Python script:

### python palestine.py
